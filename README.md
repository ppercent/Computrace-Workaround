# Computrace-Workaround
This code is meant to be executed when your device power up using task scheduler. When the computer power off it should run a script to disable wlan interface as well.

## How to use this
- Create a new task, add events trigger for start/stop session/computer
- Add both scripts (the batch & the exe file)
- Make sure the "run with admin privileges" is ticked, otherwise it won't work
- Keep in mind this doesn't fix the problem, to fix it you need to contact the company who disabled your computer.
